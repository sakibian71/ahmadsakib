                <h2>Understanding Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)</h2>
                <p class="date">Published on May 26, 2025</p>
                
                <p>
                    Simple Harmonic Motion, or SHM, is a type of motion where an object moves back and forth repeatedly around an equilibrium position. It is one of the most common types of periodic motion seen in physics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A basic example of SHM is a mass attached to a spring. When you pull the mass and release it, it moves up and down repeatedly. This motion continues as long as there is no energy loss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In SHM, the motion is smooth and follows a regular pattern. The object takes the same amount of time to complete each cycle. This kind of motion is important in many areas of science and engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Examples of SHM include the motion of a pendulum, vibrations in a guitar string, and even small movements of buildings during earthquakes. It helps us understand sound, waves, and other physical phenomena.

                <p>
                    In future posts, we'll explore more real-life examples and how SHM connects with other concepts in physics.

    <h2>Understanding Newton's Laws of Motion</h2>
    <p class="date">Published on May 26, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Newton's Laws of Motion are three fundamental rules that explain how objects move. These laws were introduced by Sir Isaac Newton and are still used today to understand everyday motion as well as complex systems in physics.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first law states that an object will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line unless something forces it to change. This means things don't start or stop moving on their own.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second law explains how force, mass, and motion are connected. If you push something harder, it moves faster. If it’s heavier, it’s harder to move.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third law is the most famous: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you push against a wall, the wall pushes back with the same force.
    </p>

    <p>
        These laws are simple but powerful. They help explain how cars move, why we need seatbelts, how rockets launch, and much more.
